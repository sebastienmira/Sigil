        <p><b>Sigil</b> is a web-application made for cryptography lovers.</p>
        <p>
            One of my favourite hobbies as a child was to crack and come up with 
            secret codes with my friends. Sigil provides you helpful tools to 
            encrypt, decrypt and analyse messages. Moreover it allows you to challenge your code-breaker 
            friends wherever they are in the world.

    <h3 class="features">Features</h3> 

    <h4>Encrypt</h4>
    <p> Allows you to encrypt any text using an alphabetic key like a Vigenere cipher.</p>

    <h4>Decrypt</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> The "known" mode allows you to decrypt a text using a known (Vigenere) key.
        </li>
        <li>The "guess" mode runs a frequency analytical attack.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The guess mode takes as input a key length and the number of attempts used to compare the letter frequency over the rows of text with the english letter frequency. It then returns a table with the most likely keys computed and the likelihood for it to be the decryption key.
    </p>
    <p>
        The likelihood value is the ratio between words in the text and English words.
    </p>

    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Perform a frequency analysis of the text.</li>
        <li>Visualise the data with tables or histograms.</li>
        <li>Allows the user to perform a manual analysis of the text.</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Chat</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows for in-chat encryption and decryption.</li>
        <li>Messages are encrypted before being sent.</li>
        <li>Allows the users the privacy of encrypted text.</li>
        <li>Allows "code-breakers" to challenge eachother with their own ciphers.</li>
    </ul>
